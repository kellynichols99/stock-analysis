<h1> Project Overview </h1>

<p>
  Our project is to simplify stock data for a select few stock tickers to allow the client to better visualize trends and encourage educated investments. Once we completed the VBA code to simplify this data from either 2017 or 2018 we were then tasked with refactoring the code in an effort to make it more efficient while maintaining accuracy.

  <h1> Results </h1>
  <p>
    I was able to update the code (Refactor Code) as requested in an effort to make the code more efficient 
    <br>

  <h4> The original run time of the code was tracked here:</h4>

  <h4> The execution run time after refactoring:</h4>

  </p>
  Based on the images of the run times I was not able to accomplish the goal of improving the run time. The times are still very close but not an improvment.

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
  I understand and support the idea of refactoring. Taking the time and effort to review and improve your code should be a possitive experience, however, it did not work in my favor this time. Generally speaking we are able to improve our work with each time we practice or look at it with a new set of eyes. This time my refactored code just missed the run time mark and took longer to run the second time around. So I am not able to say that my efforts created better efficiency in my code work. In this situation it may not have been worth the time it took to refactor the code, seeing as time invested did not make a possitive difference in the outcome. I will have to keep this in mind for future projects and will also continue to practive VBA much more in the future.
